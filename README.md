Web Box Model Highlighter

This JavaScript snippet is a console-based tool designed to help web developers and designers easily visualize and inspect the margin and padding of elements on any live webpage. It's particularly useful for debugging layouts, understanding spacing, and verifying Bootstrap spacing utility classes.
‚ú® Features

    Interactive Highlighting: Elements with margin or padding are highlighted on hover with a subtle red border.

    Detailed Popover on Hover: Hovering over a ? icon (which appears on hover) reveals a pop-up with precise pixel values for top, right, bottom, and left margins and paddings.

    Bootstrap Class Detection: Identifies and displays the corresponding Bootstrap spacing utility class (e.g., mb-3, px-2) if an element uses one.

    Non-Intrusive: The tool injects minimal CSS and JavaScript directly into the page, ensuring no disruption to the existing layout or functionality.

    Animated Transitions: Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations for highlights and popovers enhance the user experience.

    Welcome Modal: A friendly welcome message from the creator, including a link to their GitHub repositories.

üöÄ How to Use

    Open Developer Console: Navigate to the webpage you want to inspect. Open your browser's developer console:

        Chrome/Firefox/Edge: Press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (macOS).

        Go to the Console tab.

    Paste the Code: Copy the entire JavaScript code from the interactive-box-model-highlighter immersive (provided by the AI).

    Execute: Paste the copied code into the console input field and press Enter.

    Welcome Message: An initial pop-up will appear, welcoming you to the tool. You can close it or visit the creator's GitHub.

    Inspect Elements: Move your mouse over any element on the page.

        If an element has margin or padding, a red border will appear around it, along with a small ? icon in its top-right corner.

        Hover over the ? icon to see a pop-up detailing the pixel values for its margins and paddings, including the Bootstrap class if applicable.

    Cleanup: To remove all highlights and injected elements, you can refresh the page or type clearInteractiveHighlights() in the console and press Enter.
